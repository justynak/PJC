To build GameOfLife you will need a basic build system (g++, make, etc.)  You
will also need to install cmake and selected Qt4 and KDE4 development packages.
On Debian-based systems
    apt-get install build-essential kdebase-workspace-dev libqt5-dev
should be sufficient.

GameOfLife also comes with a simple configure script that should work for a
generic local install.  If it doesn't suit your needs, you will need to edit the
cmake settings by hand.

Install:
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr CMakeLists.txt
  make
  sudo make install

Note: If you do a local installation, you might not see KOceanSaver in the Screen
Saver Settings module.  In that case, you will need to do one of two things.

After that, you may need to manually refresh the system configuration cache by
running 'kbuildsycoca4'.  KOceanSaver should now appear in Screen Saver Settings.
